# NextWordPredictor

This project involves building a Natual Language Processing(NLP) model that predicts the next word present in the dataset. It invloves Machine Learning Tensorflow technique to identify the dependent and independent variables that determine the predicted words by tokenizing the words into sequences and fitting the model using probability factor of occurences of the predicted words with LSTM layers.
